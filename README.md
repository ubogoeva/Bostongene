# Bostongene
For load and process data of mutation
BostonGene_data_load.ipynb is a notebook to load maf data from https://www.cbioportal.org/ and write it to .csv format. 


I apllied two approaches to investigate cancer driver genes: dndscv (https://github.com/im3sanger/dndscv), OncodriveCLUST (https://bitbucket.org/bbglab/oncodriveclust). OncodriveCLUST was used as function realised in maftools R-package (Mayakonda A, Lin DC, Assenov Y, Plass C, Koeffler HP. 2018. Maftools: efficient and comprehensive analysis of somatic variants in cancer. Genome Research. http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.239244.118).
